<h3><a name="Overview"></a>Overview</h3>
<P>
DeadboltEdit is a basic text editor that uses strong Blowfish encryption to store files.  The program can be used to safely edit and store sensitive information that you would not want disclosed in the event that your computer is sold, stolen, or compromised by malware. Typical uses are editing website login information, and personal information that you need to have on your computer. The program can also be used to edit unencrypted plain-text files.
</p>
<p>Encrypted files can be be used as e-mail attachments. You can send encrypted information to another person who also has DeadboltEdit installed on their computer.
</p>
<p>
<b>Warning #1</b>: DeadboltEdit uses strong encryption.  The data security offered by this program is based on the use of a strong encryption method (Blowfish), which is an accepted and trusted standard for encryption.  There are no master keys, backdoors, or programming tricks that permit recovery of your encrypted data. <b>If you forget your password or pass-phrase, your data is lost.  There is absoluteley nothing the developer can do to help you recover your data.</b>
</p>

<p>
<b>Warning #2</b>: The security offered by this program can be compromised by malicious software that records keyboard activity ("key loggers"). Do not install or use this program on any computer that has doubtful security.  Computers that are shared in public areas, such as college workrooms, hotel guest areas, and libraries, should not be used with this program.
<br>
<br>
</p>

<h3>Program Features</h3>
<UL>
<li>Cross platform application: Currently supported on Mac OS X&trade;, Windows&trade;, and Linux&trade;.</li>
<li>Strong Blowfish encryption.</li>
<li>Encrypted files can be shared between Windows&trade;, Mac OS X&trade;, and Linux&trade; systems.</li>
<li>Encrypted files can be sent as e-mail attachments. (UTF-8 character encoded, MIME-Compliant formatting)</li>
<li>Secure handling of passwords: Passwords are encrypted in memory while the editor is open, except for the brief time they are used to generate encryption/decryption keys. They are NEVER stored, and no key material is stored within the encrypted files or elsewhere.</li>

<h3><a name="Editing"></a>Editing and Saving Text</h3>
<p>
DeadboltEdit is a simple and basic text editor, much like the Notepad editor on Microsoft Windows&trade;. &nbsp;The purpose of this program is to edit and safely store sensitive information. It isn't a word processor, but it is a full-featured text editor.
</p>
<p>
Encryption is integral and seamless to using the editor.  Anytime you save a file, it will be encrypted, unless you explicitly choose "Save As Plain-text File".  (See reference section below for "File Menu".)
</p>
<p>
<u>Creating A Password For A File:</u> When you save a file for the first time, you will be prompted for a password which will be used to encrypt the data.  This same password will be used to decrypt the file anytime you open the file in the future.
</p>
<p>
<b>Important:</b> Use a srong password or, even better, use a pass-phrase. Even the best encryption can be defeated by brute-force attacks if weak passwords are used. A minumum length of 8 characters is recommended.  Longer is better!  Do not use dictionary words. Mix upper-case and lower-case characters, and add numbers and special characters.
Examples of good passwords:
</p>
<UL>
<li>n0T2BAd!</li>
<li>L0nGer1sBeTter</li>
<li>Th3 k1ng is a Fink!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Pass phrases are recommended)</li>
</UL>

<p><u>Changing The Password For A File:</u> You may change the password for a file at any time.  First open the file (<font size=-1><i>"File -> Open File"</i></font>), and then choose <font size=-1><i>"File -> Password Change"</i></font>.  Text in the editor will be encrypted with the new password and then saved. The new password will be used the next time you open the file.
</p>
<br>

<br>
<br>

<h3><a name="Toolbar"></a>Toolbar</h3>
<p>
The Toolbar has graphical buttons for frequently used functions in the program menus.  The buttons are arranged in the same order as they appear in the program menus; the first five buttons are associated with functions in the "File" menu, the next three (Cut, Copy, Paste) are from the "Edit" menu, and the right-most button is program "Help".
</p>
<p>Hover the mouse cursor over a button to see a brief description for the button.
</p>
<br>
<a href="#top">Top</a>
<br>
<br>

<h3><a name="StatusLine"></a>Status Line</h3>
<p>
Program status information will appear at the bottom of the editor window, in the lower part of the window frame.  There are two display fields:
</p>
<UL>
<li>Left - File Status: This field will indicate the file type being edited, either encrypted or plain-text.  File errors and encryption errors will also be shown here if they occur.</li>
<li>Right - Edit Status: This field will indicate that the current file in the editor has been edited.  If the file has been edited, the program will also display an asterisk (*) in the window title.</li>

<h3><a name="Menu"></a>Menu Reference</h3>
<p><b>File Menu</b></p>

<UL>

<li><u><i>New Window</i></u> - Open a new editor window.  You can have multiple editor windows open, each editing a different file.
<br>
<br></li>

<li><u><i>Open </i></u> - Open a DeadboltEdit file in the current editor window.  DeadboltEdit files are named with suffix ".ctxt".
<br>
<br></li>

<li><u><i>Close</i></u> - Close the current editor window.  If the text has been modified, you will be prompted to save the file before closing the window.
<br>
<br></li>

<li><u><i>Save</i></u> - Encrypt the text in the current editor window and save to a file, using the existing file name and password.  If the file is new and has not yet been named, you will be prompted to name the file and create a password for the file.
<br>
<br></li>

<li><u><i>Save As</i></u> - Encrypt the text in the current editor window and save to a file. You will be prompted to name the file and create a password for the file.  DeadboltEdit files are named with suffix ".ctxt".
<br>
<br></li>

<li><u><i>Password Change</i></u> - Change the password for an encrypted file that is currently open in the editor. You must first open the file for this function to be enabled. You will be required to supply the current password for the file before assigning a new one.  After a new password is entered, text in the editor will be encrypted with the new password and then saved.
<br>
<br></li>

<li><u><i>Open Plain Text File</i></u> - Open a plain text (unencrypted) file.  Plain text files will normally be named with a suffix ".txt", but DeadboltEdit will accept any name.
<br>
<br></li>

<li><u><i>Save Plain Text File</i></u> - Save the text in the current editor window as a plain text file. Plain text files are usually named with suffix ".txt", but you may choose any suffix.<br>
<b>Caution</b>: If you are editing private information, it is risky to store sensitive information in plain text files, because it is difficult to securely delete these files later.
<br>
<br></li>

<li><u><i>Print</i></u> - Print the text that is in the current editor window.  A print dialog will open, which will offer printing options. Text is printed using the current editor font-style and font-size.

<UL>
<li><u><i>Undo</i></u> - Undo most recent edit, as indicated on the Edit menu (eg. "Undo addition").  The editor remembers the most recent 50 edits, and can Undo a succession of edits.  Undo is very effective with large edits, such as cutting or pasting large blocks of text.
<br>
<br></li>
<li><u><i>Redo</i></u> - Redo will restore the most recently Undone edit, provided that no edits were performed after the Undo. Redo can reapply a succession of Undo's, up to 50, if no edits have been made following the Undo's.

<br>
<br></li>

<li><u><i>Tab Size</i></u> - Set number of spaces to display for Tab characters.
<br>Usage Tip: For evenly aligned indents and columns, use a Monospace or Fixed-width font type.
<br>
<br></li>

<li><u><i>Line-Wrap</i></u> - Enable or Disable line-wrap.
<br>If Enabled: Lines of text that exceed the width of the edit window will wrap to the next line, instead of scrolling. (Line-Wrap can accomodate entire paragraphs) Text flow will recognize word boundaries and avoid splitting words.
<br>If Disabled: A horizontal scrollbar will permit scrolling text left or right. 
<br>
<br></li>

<li><u><i>Window Style</i></u> - Select a style (Look and Feel) for program windows. The first choice will be a standard window style for the system that the program is running on - Windows-style for a Microsoft Windows system, and a Macintosh-style for Mac OS systems.
<br>The second choice is called "Metal" and it is a cross-platform style.
<br> Changing the Window Style will affect the appearance of window decorations, sliders, buttons, etc. There is no impact on program functionality or data.<br>
<b>Note:</b>On MacOS, the behavior of Home and End keys will be affected by Window Style, as follows:<br>
   <UL>
   <li>Mac OS X Aqua: Behavior will be consistent with normal Mac OS behavior for editors; Home-Key will move cursor to beginning of document, and End-Key will move cursor to end of document. (Use Ctrl-A for beginning of line, and Ctrl-E for end of line.)
   </li>
   <li>Metal (Cross-Platform): Home Key will move cursor to beginning of line, and End Key will move cursor to end of line.
   </li>
   </UL>
<br>
<br></li>

<li><u><i>Degug Log</i></u> - Enable or Disable the debug log.  This should normally be OFF, because it can impact performance.  The debug log can be very helpful when troubleshooting a problem (eg. a file that cannot be opened).  The location of the file is dependent on operating system, and will be shown in the confirmation dialog that results from this choice.
<br>
<br></li>

<li><u><i>Restore Default Settings</i></u> - Reset all customized settings to their default values, as they were set when the program was first installed.
